# BlahBlah - A tool for in-real-time communication

## Why BlahBlah?

BlahBlah is built with WebSockets in mind, so that it is compatible with as many platforms as possible: desktop, web, discord bot?

## What was BlahBlah built for?

BlahBlah was built for my chat applications, and a Discord bot called Nexus. It will be used as its chatting backend in a future PR.
